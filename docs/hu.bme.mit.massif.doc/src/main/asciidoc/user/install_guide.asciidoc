As it is mostly apparent from its full name (Matlab Simulink Integration Framework for Eclipse), Massif is an Eclipse-based tool. For installing just follow these steps:

1. Download an Eclipse product from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ or use the [Eclipse installer](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)

2. Install EMF-IncQuery or VIATRA Query prerequisites:
   * Check <<../overview#, Overview>> to see which version is needed.

3. Install Massif Core components from the update site, see links on <<../overview#, Overview>>
   * Massif Matlab Communication Providers are optional, depending on which <<matlab_connectors#, connector>> you would like to use to communicate with MATLAB.
