This page is intended for developers, contributors and anyone who wants to look at the source code
in the development environment used for working on the tool.

_Please note that this tutorial is for Windows system._

We recommend using https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.oomph[Oomph] for deploying a new Massif environment,
because it's awesome!

. Download and run the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer[Eclipse installer] for your operating system.
** On the first page choose advanced mode through the setting button in the right up corner.

** On the next page choose Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers.
*** NOTE: VIATRA 2.0 has a conflicting dependency with Eclipse Parsley.
For this reason, select a product that does not have Parsley added by default.
Unfortunately, Eclipse Modeling SDK has parsley installed.
** On the projects page click the green plus button, select `Github Projects` enter
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viatra/massif/master/setup/hu.bme.mit.massif.setup/Massif.setup` and click OK

*** Note that checking the checkbox will add the optional subprojects (`Mylyn and Sonar`) as well.

*** On the next page you can see the tasks that will be executed.
*** Click finish and wait for the downloads and preparations to finish.
. Once your new and shiny Eclipse starts,
Oomph will once again pop up a wizard for completing the startup tasks.
** Just click next and you will have your workspace prepared.
** After it completes, click Finish.
** You have to do some small steps to have your Massif working:
*** Close the following projects:
**** `massif-commandevaluation-runtime`
**** `massif-communication-runtime`
**** `massif-matlabcontrol-runtime`
**** `massif-matlabengine`
**** `massif-simulink-emf`

*** Right click on `matlab.engine.api.bundle/lib/engine.jar` and open properties.
Edit the location if its not perfect.
Usually the `engine.jar` is located in the `$MATLAB_ROOT/extern/engines/java/jar` folder.
*** Open the `matlab.engine.api.bundle/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file,
and delete the row containing `com.mathworks.util.osgi,`
*** Clean projects via `Project/Clean...` with the clean all option.
. Finally, if you want, do some additional optional steps:
** In the local menu of Package Explorer,
set Top level elements to Working sets and click OK on the presented list.
** Open the following views (with Window/Show view):
*** Mylyn: Task lists, Builds (if you added the Mylyn and Sonar subproject)
*** Git: Git repositories
*** General: Properties
